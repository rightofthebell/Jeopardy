# Jeopardy
I created python scripts to scrape J-Archive (a Jeopardy fan-site) to get all of the recorded questions and answers. I then built an iPhone app to play historic Jeopardy games.

The second picture after showing the answer. Currently the scoring isn't implimented yet.

There is also built-in text-to-speech.

The crawler pulls from J-Archive and gets everything into JSON format. The JSON object is large, so be careful how you open it.
